# MX2MID
MusyX (GBC) to MIDI converter

This tool converts music from Game Boy Color games using the MusyX sound engine (by Factor 5) to MIDI format.

It works with ROM images. To use it, you must specify the name of the ROM followed by the number of the main bank containing the sound data (in hex).
In addition to converting MIDI files, this tool also includes a mode to rip samples from games that use PCM samples or waveforms to WAV format. This mode can be used by using the parameter "S" at the end. The parameter "M" at the end is used to extract music; however, this is optional.

Examples:
* MX2MID "Uno (E) (M6) [C][!].gbc" 2 M
* MX2MID "Shrek - Fairy Tale Freakdown (U) (M6) [C][!].gbc" 66 M
* MX2MID "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (UE) (M13) [C][!].gbc" 10 M

Although there already exists Python tools (https://github.com/GauChoob/musyx) that can extract MIDIs and samples from games using this sound engine, it is very difficult to get working, and is likely more suited to replacing/hacking audio data. Using the information specified at the link, I was able to create my own converter which is much easier to use. Also included, as usual, is a "prototype" converter, MX2TXT.
